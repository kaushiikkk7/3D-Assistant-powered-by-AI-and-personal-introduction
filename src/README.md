### _by Kaushik Mondal_

Welcome to the official repository of my solo-developed project — a futuristic **3D Voice Assistant** powered by **OpenAI GPT-4**, **React Three Fiber**, and **ElevenLabs**. This assistant is designed to **converse naturally in English and Hindi**, react visually with facial expressions and lip-sync, and present personal or professional details through an engaging, immersive interface.

> 🎓 Built as part of my portfolio to showcase skills in AI integration, frontend 3D animation, cloud services, and voice interaction.
